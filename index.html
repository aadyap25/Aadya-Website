      <p id="meme">The laughing skull is an exciting and a horror full story. The haunted incidents run chills in our spine and give us goosebumps. These type of incidents makes the story riveting word by word and grips the reader. In the first few stories, readers might feel a little scared reading the stories, but not to worry, because soon they will get a hang of it, and will be able to find some humor in those stories as well. The stories gradually become interesting and creepier, so one should be prepared to read them because I was quite skeptical and petrified to read them.</p>

  <p id="memo">Born in a workhouse, the orphan Oliver Twist was sold to an apprenticeship with an undertaker. After escaping, Oliver travels to London, where he meets Artful Dodger a member of a gang of underage pickpockets led by the elderly criminal Fagin. Oliver Twist portrays the shabby lives of the criminals and exposes the cruel treatment of the orphans in London. This novel remains the true depiction of human struggles and advancement.

    This novel is really a masterpiece for than one reason. The English is so rich that I had to use the dictionary continuously throughout the book. In my opinion, the novel is quite entertaining and it makes you want to read it again and again. I even like the fact that Fagin and everyone tried to change Oliver, but he still continued to be an innocent, decent boy. Great work done by Dickens as this story was an easy way to learn about life in 1800’s England

<p id="okay">The first baby of the Button family arrives and everyone gets excited and thrilled until the moment the baby is revealed to the father. It turns out to be an old man, not at all understanding the ways babies are supposed to behave instead being entertained by the grandfather of the Button family. The family tries to treat the old man as a baby. Benjamin struggles with college applications and finding his love. Years pass by Benjamin and his family starts to notice that he is getting younger day by day instead of getting older and dying of old age. But Benjamin was not comfortable with getting young; he was very used to being old!I would give this book 4 stars. I am not giving this book 5 stars just because it could have been much better if the story would have been longer. It could have given the tiniest of details and we could have learnt about his life in-depth like his struggles and happiness. I would surely recommend other people to read this book, I am sure they too would love and enjoy this book.

  <p id="heart">“Ahhh, why does this happen to me?” I thought while walking in the hallway “Why am I the one getting after-school detention when it wasn’t even my fault. Tess was at fault, but she is enjoying her ice cream while I sit in the school for 1 ½ hour. Can someone not just save me? I am sure to die in detention. Detention stinks!! Urgh, Tess, I am not gonna spare you, girl!”
    Soon, I reached room 124, where my detention was held. I never knew, that our school had room 124. The room looked mysterious from the outside, the door was black, and the outside board didn’t have anything hanging on it, unlike ours. I was 5 minutes early but thought to walk in. I knocked on the door, a few times but no one opened the door, so I pushed the door and walked in. As usual, I didn’t know the teacher, every time I get detention, I never get a teacher who I know. Quite unusual, I know that. The teacher wore black pants, and a dark brown, stained shirt. His eyes were small but dark and resembled black marbles. He saw me sit on the 3rd bench, but never greeted nor introduced his name. Quite odd, isn’t it? 
    “Miss Olivia, come sit on the first bench.” The teacher said in a crooked voice.
    “Ye…Yes, Teacher” I said nervously.
    He still never introduced himself to me, so curiously I asked him.
    “Teacher, may I know your name? You never introduced yourself to me!”
    “Cadaver, my name is Cadaver” 
    “Uh, Ok. Thanks, Mr. Cadaver” 
    “A funny and odd name.” I spoke under my breath “Cadaver? Who has this name?”
    Like, literally who has this name. I had never even heard this name, nor I knew its meaning. I looked at my watch, it was 2:30 pm. I still had 1 hour and 15 mins more to go. I patiently waited for a few minutes, for Mr. Cadaver to give some work. But he never spoke. 
    “Mr. Cadaver, can….can I take a dictionary to read, from the class library? I stammered.
    “You may.” 
    So, I got up and went towards the class library; took the dictionary to read from there, and came back to my seat. Soon, I searched for new words and started alphabetically. 
    “Ascendency; occupation of dominant power,” I said in a low voice
    Soon, I started to flip pages and came to the letter C. There were, Corn, Cactus, Carrots, Cadaver, etc.
    “Cadaver? That is the name of the teacher sitting in front of me!” I exclaimed in my mind
    Soon, I read the meaning of his name it said a Corpse; a dead body. I was stunned and a little creeped out by the meaning.
    “What a meaning! Corpse and a dead body, scary!!” I said under my breath
    Soon, I got tired of reading the dictionary and thought to go into the hallway for some fresh air.
    “Mr. Cadaver, can I go to the loo?” I asked him, with my most polite ways 
    “Come soon!”
    And I went out, I roamed the hallway for a few minutes, and decided to use the loo finally. While washing my hands, after using the loo I saw a face in the mirror, it had no ears or nose. It just had dark brown eyes and a smirk. I screamed and blinked my eyes a few times and pleaded to God that it was just a hallucination. When I finally opened my eyes and saw the mirror, it was dead clean. Nothing was on there. But I ran as fast as I could. While running I fell over something and bumped my head onto the ground. For a few seconds, I laid down and finally got the strength to stand up. But, as soon as I stood up, the sky went dark, just like it is the night. A few seconds before falling it was just fine, but now? I went blank. 
    “What is happening? It’s only 3:00 pm. I think I am gonna go mad!! This all is happening because of Tess. Detention sucks, man!” 
    I slowly walked down the hallway and reached Room 124. I knocked, but no one answered, so I just barged in. I didn’t see Mr. Cadaver. My eyes were continuously searching for him. 
    “Mr. Cadaver, where are you? I, Olivia has come back!” 
    Neither I heard any sound nor I saw him. Soon I noticed a sticky substance under my shoes, it was dark and a little thick than water. And soon I realized that it was BLOOD!
    “Blood? Where did this come from?” I asked myself
    Soon, I traced down the blood. It was flowing out from under the teacher’s desk. I went there and check. I was left stunned!! It was Mr. Cadaver, blood was oozing out from him, his eyes became big, and stopped blinking. So, it was easy for me to say, that he died! 
    “But, how did he? He was fine when I left. What happened to him? Did he have a heart attack? Did someone murder him?” 
    Before I could do something, I saw Mr. Cadaver disappear into thin air. Soon after a few seconds, I could hear whispers of his name! And lights started to flicker. 
    “Ahhhh! God, save me!!” I screamed
    And soon, there was a big bang. I closed my eyes and waited for a few seconds. And, I sprinted out of the room, slamming the door after me. I ran into the hallway and came across a dictionary lying down. I recognized at once, that it was the same dictionary that I was reading, earlier. 
    “How did it come here? Who brought it here?” 
    I looked around and spotted no one. The whole floor was empty, which was quite strange, as the teachers normally stay till 4:15 pm. I picked up the dictionary, to examine it. And saw that all the words starting from C were missing!

  <p id="AWA">It was 2:38 pm when I entered Room 103 for my after-school detention. I didn’t recognize the teacher who was there waiting for me. It wasn’t the regular teacher, Mrs. Kauff. None of the other students who got detention was there. All I could see were paintings containing creepy humans hanging on the walls. The aircon was at a high temperature, my legs were already shivering. The whole atmosphere there was quite eery and creepy. So, I decided to sit on the 2nd bench, which was sufficiently far from the direct aircon. The teacher was sitting in an awkward position, under the direct aircon and facing a painting containing a burned skin man smirking. He was so engaged in reading his book, that he didn’t even notice me enter. I hadn’t brought any books with me because I was told Miss Chloe had a special assignment for me waiting.
      “It probably had something to do with cleaning the big mess I made in the Lab room, I thought. But I really didn’t mean to do it, or did I? What kind of teacher gives their students sulfuric acid to play with? I just added water to its concentrated form…… and the rest is history. Kinsley’s hand was burning and she was screaming like crazy. She went bananas.” 
      It was just in 5 mins, I got bored so I decided to ask the teacher what I should be doing. So, I walked slowly to his desk. And cleared my throat.
      “Excuse me, sir,” I said, using my most polite voice, “I am Sarah Lestwood, the student responsible for the… um… chem… chemistry incident…. accident. Should I go get some homework?” 
      I don’t know why my voice sounded so shaky; I am usually confident around teachers. But this one certainly did shake me. This one was strange, and out of the ordinary! And after a few minutes of silence, he opened his mouth and with a rough, raspy voice he started speaking to me. 
      “Oh, Sarah you came! Good thing you did as Miss Chloe has something planned for you already. Let me just read out her note.” 
      This was quite strange; he didn’t look back at me while talking. He was still staring at the painting. While he pulled open the drawer of the desk with his odd-looking fingers and shuffled through it until he brought out a small post-it, I got a glance of his left hand. 
      “Shocking…Strange…Surreal! Does he have a metal arm? What happened to his arm? Quite creepy!” I said to myself under my breath. 
      “Ah, yes. First off don’t call me sir, call me Mr. Wyatt” He croaked and began reading aloud from the note, “Sarah Lestwood is in for a treat. She will not be released from Room 103 until she has thoroughly learned her lesson. Also, she needs to………”
      Mr. Wyatt continued reading the note to himself. Soon, he turned towards me but to my surprise, he was wearing a surgical mask. Why was he? Does he have a cold? Is he hiding something? These types of questions surrounded my mind. He still kept on reading the note, his eyes grew wider, darker, and then chuckled at the end. 
      “Very well Sarah”, he sighed “Let us begin.”
      Suddenly the lights in the room flickered off.
      “Ah, what’s happening?” I asked myself.
      
       It was pitch black except for a small light coming from the hallway. Mr. Wyatt took off his mask, and his skin started to glow oddly, and his thin lips curved upward into a creepy smile. He stood up. He must be nearly 6 ½ feet tall. He looked quite eccentric to me now. This was the strangest detention I have ever had! Soon, the man came near me, grabbed my hand, and held it tightly in his clenched fist. 
      “Ahhhh! Mr. Wyatt, stop it! It hurts” I screamed.
      “Shush! Now, you will get the taste of your own medicine,” he crackled. “About 30 years ago, another student was even more careless than you. My entire face was destroyed in the accident. So, I left the school, shunned by my classmates and my family.” 
      Then there was silence for a minute
      “Poor Kinsley! She burnt her….” I thought.
      He let go of me and smiled, showing all his pale, horrible, pale teeth. Slowly, he took my index finger and dipped it in a beaker. For a second, I went blank but as soon as the sulfuric acid touched my skin, burning it immediately, I screamed a silent scream. No sound would come out, the pain was indescribable. Mr. Wyatt or should I simply say monstrous man laughed his horrible laugh as I groaned and twitched with anguish. After what seemed like an eternity, he finally stopped. And I collapsed on the hard marble floor. When I finally awoke, somewhere at 5:43 pm, the monstrous man wasn’t there. My hand was numb, and I certainly didn’t want to look at it. 
      “Anyone there? Anyone? Help me!” I screamed, but in a low voice.
      “Sarah, I am here!” whispered a voice “Yes, I am…. Need any help?” 
      “Oh no, who is this now? The ghost of Mr. Wyatt? I mumbled to myself “Annabelle? Who is this?” 
      After that, the room was silent again. I stood up dizzily and stumbled upon a few steps to regain my balance. I looked around the room, but no one was there! I ran out of the room, into the hallway, and saw the room’s light flickering again. And I ran out of the school as fast as I could but I clearly didn’t know where I was headed!!

  <p id="ARWAA">Monarchy, a term that not many people might have heard, or might not be interested in. Monarchy is a political system based upon the rule of a single person (Kind/Queen). One of the most famous monarchies is Queen Elizabeth II. Queen Elizabeth II in full Queen Elizabeth Alexandra Mary Windsor was born on April 21, 1926. She was an elder sister to Princess Margaret, Countess of Snowdon. She was privately tutored at home, by some prominent teachers; and began her social services at the age of 19 during the Second World War, serving in the Auxiliary Territorial Service. Elizabeth II was married to Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh on November 20, 1947. After 6 years of her marriage, her father died and she was coronated on June 2, 1953, when she was still at the tender age of 27. Coronation marked herself as a Queen of London and the seven independent Commonwealth countries: United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, Pakistan, and Ceylon. Soon, she had four kids: Charles, Prince of Wales; Anne, Princess Royal; Andrew, Duke of York; Edward, Earl of Wessex. Prince Charles, being the eldest, is next in the line of succession. He has been one of the most loved ones by his parents. His age is currently 73 years old, and still, he hasn’t been crowned, the King; because his mother is still alive! God knows when Prince Charles will inherit the crown! It has been nearly 70 Years of reign by Queen Elizabeth II. She is the longest-reigning and the oldest-reigning British monarch in their history. A few years ago (2-3 years) she broke her great-great grandmother’s record (Queen Victoria). She is currently 96 years old, and she is fit as a fiddle. Who knows she might be having a secret potion? Or a secret pill? Prince Philip, her husband died on April 9, 2021, just 2 months before his 100th birthday; ending his and Elizabeth’s 74-year-old relationship. Wouldn’t that be heartbreaking for her? And did you know, that Prince Philips, used to walk a few steps behind her majesty? Crazy isn’t it? Prince Philip never got a chance to be a king, sad isn’t it?

Being a part of the royal family might be bliss but following the rules set for the royals are quite tough to follow, so tough that sometimes they themselves break rules.

Royals have to dress up formally, even when eating dinner. Do you know why? Because once a gardener mistook Prince Philip for a chef just because he was in his pajamas. Funny, isn’t it?
Have you ever thought, why does every royal carry an all-black dress while traveling? They carry an all-black dress in case of sudden death where they must attend the funeral. Once a royal forgot to carry her all-black dress while traveling and had to wait for hours, till her all-black dress came after being shipped with her maids. She wasn’t allowed to attend the funeral until she wore an all-black dress. Crazy, isn’t it?
 A royal must accept all the gifts they get, even if a present is lame. Agreeable and nice right? But wait until the twist comes, the Queen decides which gift will be given to whom!
  As soon as the Queen finishes with her food, you too have to stop eating, even if you haven’t finished. What a silly rule!
Wedding dresses, have to be approved by the Queen. If the queen doesn’t like it, so do you!
 No Ring? No tiara! Only married women are allowed to wear tiaras. Plus, on the day of the wedding, the queen chooses the bride’s tiara. What? People in the royal family don’t make their own choices!  
No garlic in the palace. The queen hates garlic plus it makes your mouth stink, so no garlic available.
2 heirs can’t fly together. For example, Prince Charles and Prince William can’t fly on the same plane, because they both are in the line of succession. This, protocol can save one heir if the other lands in a tragic accident and dies.
These are only some of the rules, they have to follow. The list is never-ending. So, I suppose I ran out of space. Till then, see ya and check out some secret potions that the Queen might be drinking!

    <p id="AKK">Ahhhh, my heart just shattered, listening to your passing away. You will be missed forever, your name is engraved in our hearts till we die. Kido, weren’t you a sweet, little pet? You came in the year 2007 and brought happiness with you. I wasn’t there at that time, but still the stories I have heard, come up to this conclusion. You were a small little pup, furry, energetic, cute, tiny and so many other adjectives can be used for you.

      You used to jump around, climb on people’s bodies and eat a lot of biscuits, these were your trademarks. You never missed doing these things. You caused troubles on one hand, but no one ever minded. You lit up the house, just like lights do. All one could hear was the sounds of the footsteps you made! Wasn’t that cute? I was born 3 years after you, and have been seeing you since then. I frankly don’t remember you being little and energetic, just like a pup is. I never spent that much time, with you as I was little and was miles away from you at that time. I, have only seen you old, crying in pain, and having many other issues. I used to meet, you like every month for the past 1 ½ year. My love and affection towards you never changed, but the thing that changed was your age, your condition, you grew sicker day by day, but still, that never affected me in terms of loving you.
     
      
     
      Whenever I used, to take my online classes you used to invade it by sitting just next to me. Sometimes, I would be frustrated but now as I think about those times, I miss the invasion of yours dearly. Me, taking my classes, the door is locked and you knocking at the door, is what I miss. I would sometimes, ignore that knock of yours, but I feel sorry for that, now. It was a visual delight to see you roaming around the house, wagging your silky tail, and going behind people for some treats... I have seen you bathing and showing tantrums. The way your hair used to come in bundles after wiping your body looked so cute. I have only attended one birthday, which was on 27.12.2020. But who knew, that it would be the first and last birthday as me as your guest. You were there with everyone for 14 years, getting scolded and getting loved. You were and are the best dog, anyone could get.
     
      
     
      Sometimes, I would get naughty, and slowly step on your tail (Not that hard) and run away. At that time, I wasn’t aware of you being hurt or being in pain, I just enjoyed seeing you roam around and trying to find, who did that. But now as I look back, I am sorry! For my actions. I wasn’t there, the day you died. I wish I could have seen you for the last time. I still have regrets about not being there, but why harshly take this? At least I get to see, your grave (The place you were buried) whenever I come to Nanu’s house. You died last year, 20.05.2021, and it’s been a year since you have gone, but no one has forgotten you, and will not for the rest of our lives. I miss you my Kido!!

  <p id="ARWAA"> <h3>A pleasant day </h3> <br>
    It was a pleasant day<br>
    The Sun was rising<br>
    The birds were chirping<br>
    People were sleeping<br>
    Some people got up and some were still asleep<br>
    The clouds were white and were shining<br>
    There were no cars on the roads<br>
    The roads were secluded<br>
    The beaches were wet<br>
    The water was flowing everywhere on the beach

    <p id="ARWAA"> <h3>I was Dreaming</h3><br>
      It was beautiful. <br>
      It was green and clean. <br>
      The smell of fresh air,<br>
      The sound of the river flowing,<br>
      I love everything happening there.<br>
      I pinched myself to see if it was real.<br>
      That was when I realized I was dreaming.<br>
      Couldn't it be real?<br>
      Now all wasted.<br>
      The color is just awful.<br>
      The smell of pollution is killing me.<br>
      The sound of traffic is giving me a headache.<br>
      I wanted my perfect dream to come through.<br>
      But again, I was dreaming! 

      <p id="ARWAA"> <h3>Come To The Beach</h3><br>
Come to the beach<br>
Where the ocean is blue<br>
And the little smooth waves<br>
come running at you<br>
The sand starts tingling<br>
Under your toes<br>
You stand very still<br>
And there the wave goes<br>
We will build a castle<br>
Nearby the sea<br>
Relax and sunbathe<br>
Trust me you will see

<p id="ARWAA"> <h3>Let’s Preserve our Nature</h3>
  The sun is shining<br>
  The sky is blue<br>
  The birds are flying<br>
  And the breeze is so cool.<br>
  Mother Nature is trying her best<br>
  To give nothing but beautifulness<br>
  But what do we do?<br>
 Make her a mess.	<br>
  Let's make her the best<br>
  By polluting less and less,<br>
  And preserve her green dress<br>
  For the rest.

  <p id="ARWAA"> <h3>Summer</h3>
Summer has come<br>
We will eat some plum<br>
Let’s have some fun<br>
While playing in the sun<br>
It’s not the time to play on slides<br>
Rather enjoy the water rides<br>
We need to eat ice-cream<br>
Otherwise, we will scream<br>
At last, summer has gone

<p id="ARWAA"> <h3>Global Warming</h3>
  Burning hot temperatures<br>
  More gases in the air<br>
  Overflowing mother nature<br>
  Does anyone really care?<br>
  Earth will need a fan or two<br>
  When the time comes near<br>
  Are we out of control with the oil spills?<br>
  I think that we must fear<br>
  The factories not listening to what we have to say<br>
  We must save our Earth<br>
  And we must save it today!

    We the Springdalians,<br>
Enjoy every moment we spend in school,<br>
Here, we proudly say that the studies are very cool,<br>
It's been 67 years to Springdales history,<br>

Happy 67 Springdales!


    <p id="ILAR"> <h3>Happy Father’s Day</h3>
      He never looks for praises.<br>
      He's never one to boast.<br>
      He just goes on quietly working<br>
      For those he loves the most.<br>
      His dreams are rarely spoken.<br>
      His wants are very few,<br>
      And most of the time his worries<br>
      Will go unspoken, too.<br>
      He's there...a firm foundation<br>
      Of our family. 

      <p id="ILAR"> <h3>Happy Birthday Mommy</h3>
        Your birthday is the day I remember<br>
all the wonderful things you do.<br>
Time will fly and each day goes by,<br>
and I've forgotten to say, "Thank you."<br>
Thank you for teaching me strength,<br>
to have confidence while I grow,<br>
for helping me through my biggest challenges,<br>
and for teaching me what I know.

<p id="ILAR"> <h3>Happy Mother Day!</h3>
Mommy, I love you<br>
More than you see<br>
You have always been there<br>
Where I needed you to be<br>
I wish there was more<br>
For you, I could do<br>
But all I can say<br>
Is how much I love you<br>
It is deeper than the oceans<br>
Higher than the sun<br>
I could shout it forever<br> 
And still not be done!

  <p id="sps"> <h3>Healthy Hero</h3>
I like fruits, I can it eat it all day<br>
My mom says it keeps the doctor away<br>
I like vegetables too!<br>
My mom says they are good for you!<br>
I like eggs, pulses and cheese<br>
And then my mom says these foods make muscles just like these!<br>
But I really love chocolates and chips<br>
My mom says they contain a lot of fat<br>
I wanna say, I don’t want to become a figure zero<br>
Hence, I will become a healthy food hero!<br>

<p id="sps"> <h3>Healthy Pledge</h3>
  I pledge to stay healthy and clean<br>
Through my exercise and good hygiene<br>
I will eat balanced meals every day<br>
To have more energy to study and play<br>
Every night I will have a good rest<br>
And will always be ready to do my best!<br>
If I work hard, to be healthy and strong<br>
I will be happy all my life long

<p id="sps"> <h3>Health In Wealth</h3>
  Healthy body sure makes an active mind<br>
  Once sick you can’t make good things rewind<br>
  Beware of taking too much of everything<br>
  After all, good health is wealth and is the world’s best thing!!!
